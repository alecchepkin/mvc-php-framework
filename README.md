# PHP Technical Test #

This is a short exercise to assess your PHP and database skills, as well as your general coding style. It should take around three hours to complete but a fully working site isn’t necessary if time is limited. We’re looking to learn how you approach and implement a problem rather than how good a site you can build.
## Requirements ##
1.	Should be written in object-oriented PHP.
2.	Should be all self-written, no existing frameworks or libraries.
3.	Should have good basic security (e.g. hashed passwords, protect against SQL injection).
4.	Should use a MySQL database to store post data. User login data can be stored anywhere.
## Specification ##
Build a very simple blog with the following functionality:
### Front end: ###
1.	View a list of blog posts showing the title, body truncated to 100 characters, and date. It should show only the latest 5 posts.
2.	View a single blog post showing the title, full body, and date.
### Back end: ###
1.	Admin login – multiple users not required.
2.	View a list of all the blog posts.
3.	Add a new blog post with a title and body. Title should allow a maximum of 50 characters.
4.	Edit an existing blog post.
5.	Delete a blog post.
6.	Logout.
HTML and CSS should be kept to the bare minimum needed to make the site functional – this exercise is purely to assess how you approach the problem and not how good it looks.
